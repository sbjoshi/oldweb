###Research

#### Research simplified
 
An essential part of science is to be able to explain your work in simple terms to others. Here are some simple explanations by some of my students about their work in their own words.

#### Tools


##### **VerifOx**

VerifOx is a symbolic execution engine built on top of [CPROVER](http://www.cprover.org) framework. It is especially optimized
for behaviourally equivalent C programs that are generated from Verilog circuits. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00169.pdf)

##### **CBMC-Repair**


[CBMC-Repair](http://www.cprover.org/glue) is built on top of [CPROVER](http://www.cprover.org) model-checking
frame work which suggests optimum fence placement in a C program. [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7443)



##### **Open-WBO**



[Open-WBO](http://sat.inesc-id.pt/open-wbo/) is an open source MaxSAT solver which can use any [MiniSAT](http://www.minisat.se) like off-the-shelf SAT solver underneath.
Open-WBO __won 2 gold and 1 silver in the MaxSAT 2017 evaluations__. It also __won the MaxSAT 2014 evaluations__ for unweighted MaxSAT category for __industrial benchmarks__. It also secured
__a second place__ for partial MaxSAT category for __industrial benchmarks__. It was __ranked secnd and third__ for various categories of benchmarks in __[Pseudo-Boolean Competition 2016](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB16/)__. Relevant papers are  [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4628) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05920.pdf).



##### **Summarizer (aka 2LS) **


[summarizer](http://www.cprover.org/wiki/doku.php?id=2ls_for_program_analysis) is a software verifier for C programs which uses a holistic combination of bounded model-checking,
k-induction and abstract interpretation. [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05671) 
*summarizer* aka *2LS* won gold in floating point category
at [SVCOMP 2016](http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2016/results/results-verified/)




##### **Walcyrie**



[Walcyrie](https://github.com/gan237/walcyrie) is a modification over [CBMC](http://www.cprover.org/cbmc) model-checker that employs better encoding to
make the model-checking more efficient over relaxed memory models.
