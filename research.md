# Research

### Research simplified
 
An essential part of science is to be able to explain your work in simple terms to others. Here are some simple explanations by some of my students about their work in their own words.

* MaxSAT Evaluations 2015 : 1 Gold medal, 1 Silver medal
* MaxSAT Floc Olympic Games 2014: 2 Gold medals
* MaxSAT Evaluations 2014: 1 Gold medal, 1 Silver medal

Relevant papers are  [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4628),  [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05920.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07164.pdf).

##### **Pinaka**

[Pinaka](https://github.com/sbjoshi/Pinaka) (named after the bow of Lord Shiva) is a symbolic execution engine built on top of  CPROVER/SYMEX framework.

Accolade won by Pinaka:
* 3rd place in ReachSafety-Floats subcategory, 8th in ReachSafety category and 6th in Termination category at SVCOMP 2020.  Fastest 
 in all categories participated  whenever Pinaka produced answers for benchmarks.
* 2nd place in ReachSafety-Floats subcategory in SVCOMP 2019.



##### **VerifOx**

VerifOx is a symbolic execution engine built on top of [CPROVER](http://www.cprover.org) framework. It is especially optimized
for behaviourally equivalent C programs that are generated from Verilog circuits. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00169.pdf)

##### **Summarizer (aka 2LS)**


[summarizer](http://www.cprover.org/wiki/doku.php?id=2ls_for_program_analysis) is a software verifier for C programs which uses a holistic combination of bounded model-checking,
k-induction and abstract interpretation. [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05671) 
*summarizer* aka *2LS* won gold in floating point category
at [SVCOMP 2016](http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2016/results/results-verified/)


##### **CBMC-Repair**


[CBMC-Repair](http://www.cprover.org/glue) is built on top of [CPROVER](http://www.cprover.org) model-checking
frame work which suggests optimum fence placement in a C program. [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7443)





##### **Walcyrie**



[Walcyrie](https://github.com/gan237/walcyrie) is a modification over [CBMC](http://www.cprover.org/cbmc) model-checker that employs better encoding to
make the model-checking more efficient over relaxed memory models.
